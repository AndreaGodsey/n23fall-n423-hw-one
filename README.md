# Description

A three page application for The Cat API assignment. This website is called The Cat Library, and navigates to a Home, Favorites, and More Details page. The home page has a button that loads a list of cat images. There is a save button that will save the image to the user's favorites page. The More Details button takes
the user to a detailed page about the cat the user clicked on. The favorites page has a description, as well as has a button that changes the user's usernames. The button changes the usernames from "Anxious", "Excited", and "Funny". There is also a description on the home page about the website itself. The More Details page contains the breed, temperament, life-span, affection level, and the rating of how child friendly the cat is. There are rating icons that were created using semantic-ui next to affection level and child friendly sections. Finally, there are two navigation buttons at the top that take the user to the favorites and the home page.
